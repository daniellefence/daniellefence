    "content": "So unprofessional, truly. I would not do business with this company if they were the last fencing company in Florida. I called for a very simple fence repair for a PVC fence (I literally need two posts and enough arms to put the fence back up). I was told, without Danielle Fence sending anyone to look at my fence OR without asking for pictures, that Danielle Fence simply cannot do the job. They don't carry the fencing. I asked how they know without seeing what my standard suburban PVC fence looks like and the guy said they just won't have it. They essentially carry elite materials that are so unique and the measurements are special that other vendor materials simply cannot compete and are less than Danielle Fence materials. Once more I asked how he has this wisdom to know this is the case (I live in a cookie cutter neighborhood) and he said to send a picture. So, I guess the guy has magic abilities to measure from a picture and tell clients to pound sand if the original fence wasn't from Danielle Fence. I'll go with a local mom & pop fencing company can magically find the right fencing to use. In fact, my second call got it done! People, give your money to a company that isn't high and mighty and that cares about their communities of interest. Danielle Fence, might want to fire that guy. He referenced 60,000 calls post Milton and said Danielle Fence simply doesn't carry those subpar materials. Imagine the revenue your company is missing. But, hey, that guy is the face and voice of your company. Jeff Friedrich 9 reviews \u2022 3 photos Outstanding Work\u2014My Go-To Fence Company! I\u2019ve used this company multiple times now, and they continue to exceed expectations. Most recently, they installed a 6\u2019 vinyl privacy fence in my backyard and a 48\u201d aluminum fence across the front\u2014and the results are flawless. From to finish, the team was professional, detail-oriented, and right on schedule. They communicated clearly throughout the process, showed up when they said they would, and left the job site clean and tidy. The craftsmanship is top-notch, and it\u2019s clear they take pride in their work. It\u2019s rare these days to find contractors who deliver on all fronts\u2014quality, timeliness, and professionalism\u2014but this team does just that. I won\u2019t use anyone else for fencing work and confidently recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality installation with zero hassle. A+ experience every time. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f"

Paid close to 9K back in 2021 for this job. Fast forward 2.5 years later a hole to open up under a fence post. When contacted for a repair they told me it wasn't covered under a warranty and it \"looked like a sink hole\", then quoted me 850$ for a repair. I ended up doing it myself for 35$ worth of quikcrete and a little sweat. During my repair I discovered the cause of the issue is that they broke open the French drain and the cloth covering around it so they caused this erosion or \"sink hole\". Ok product like any other vinyl fence, but awful customer service, once they got your money they don't care about you. Update after response: it's extremely likely the installers cracked the French drain, there was never any digging in that area, no trees, fences, anything. At this point it doesn't matter, I fixed what these \"professionals\" couldn't."

They cleaned up our yard before leaving. We love our new fence and gates! UPDATE: we had an inground pool built in our backyard. This required removing 13 sections of the fence for the equipment to access the backyard. Danielle sent a crew that carefully removed the fence sections and then wrapped and stacked the sections in our garage for us. Last week they sent two crew members to reinstall the fence for us.

They used our property to access the neighbor's--including literally tearing down a vine that I had intentionally let grow from a trellis on our property to a tree on our property--without permission and after being told repeatedly to stay out of my easily accessible side yard that was not there for their convenience. They wandered around on our property to install the fence, probably because our ground is flat and cleared, while the neighbor's is an uneven drift of brush piled up against the old, dilapidated fence. They left--UNDER the new fence and protruding into our yard--the literal TRASH and mess of vegetation that had been mounded against the sagging, old fencing. They dumped dirt on top of our clean pine straw. They never asked permission to be on our property. They damaged our landscaped space. They never returned repeated phone calls to discuss their actions. So, if you want to abuse and usurp on your community, this is definitely the company for you--otherwise, I would encourage you to look elsewhere.

They originally told us 4-8 weeks, but they were able to get us on the schedule in 2! Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and the crew that came to install the fence was phenomenal. They arrived right on time at 7:30 am, and despite a few unexpected delays, which were handled quickly and efficiently, they were finished with the whole thing by 3:00 the same day. I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone in the area needing a fence, and would definitely hire them again!"

I regret using them to install my fence. There are other companies that charge less with the same quality. I will never introduce anyone or family member to this company as they are only about what they get from you and not about their customer. My fence is still not closed since the half baked install; uncompleted work. I will have to raise $900+ to complete their payment. One of the owners arrogantly said that there is nothing they can do to meet me halfway to settle the miscommunication between the me and the technician. I have to raise that money to pay them off. Greg who is one of their managers is awesome with a great customer service skill. Because of Greg I will refer others to them. Thanks"

After hurricane Ian if you noticed a fence down mostly likely it was a Danielle Fence, based on the signs on them. They mostly install the outside fencing for residential communities. My fence that was installed last year at my home is not longer in a straight line, it is swaging. Also the top vertical bars are held together with screws and bolts but they fail to mention this as far as materials used. The fence that I saw hold up to a hurricane was Fence Central and Cambridge. A good company is one that stands by there product. Danielle Fence told me it is not covered by hurricanes. know I'm curious to know how much they are gonna tell me this will be. I will be back on to give you all the update on my appointment with them. And I will be happy to change this rating if this issue is rectified. Danielle Fence came out on 12/13/2022 and they told us that they would give us a quote on what needed to be done and and as of to date 1/8/2023, they have not reached back out to us."

We requested they fix our fence which had minimal damage compared to others (back leaning in from wind, bottom rail slightly bowed but sections intact, only one small panel out) after a hurricane. They charged $964 to stick boards under fence to raise panels and then pounded in posts (never took any part of the fence apart or replaced anything except one post top). The one small panel that had popped out they just kept banging on it until it popped into place - never removed the top rail. They didn\u2019t even bring dirt to backfill. Then I specifically told them the bottom of fence had to be off the ground for drainage. My husband called that afternoon because at least 3 - 4 panel sections were sitting on the ground and requested they come out to raise them and make all posts even to height of corner posts. They came out a couple weeks later but only raised the right corner posts and workers said intake caller only did work order for raising the corner post up not raising back fence panel sections. My husband called the office and left message while workers were there. No phone call for two weeks until I called and inquired about voicemail. Then husband gets a call saying we would have to pay more money if they came out again.

    "content": "Absolutely horrible experience with this company. They installed a fence on the back line of my property for an adjacent corporate building contract and broke irrigation lines on my property. I saw their installers walking the line and checking over the job when finished and (they were on other side of fence so I only saw hands and feet) saw one of them pushing dirt up into a hole under the fence. Didn't think anything of it at the time until I realized my irrigation had run the previous night. I went to check area and found the dirt they were pushing was to cover up the hole my irrigation washed out and the sprinkler head was thrown into my yard apparently for me to deal with. I contacted the company and was given the run around, being told that property lines and survey lines would need to be checked and began putting the blame on the builder. What? Don't they do this prior to installing a fence? Anyway, property lines were not the issue. It was that they broke it, they knew it, and tried to cover it up and leave someone else to fix. If this is the way they operate when they think no one is watching, it's not a company I'd ever do business with. Guess big corporate accounts are more important that the little guy and doing what's right.

Sent Richard an email in what I was looking to have done. He responded back with a quote by just the survey. With a \"ballpark \" price. I went ahead and set up an appointment to have Thom come out and get the exact footage roughly a 1,000 feet of mixed Aluminum and 6' solid vinyl fence. Richards quote and Thoms actual measurements were within dollars of each other. The quotes that I received from different companies comparing \"apples to apples \" were close price wise. The only difference was that Danielle Fence has all of the vinyl fence made in AMERICA!! NOT SHIPPED IN FROM OVERSEAS. With spending well over 10K for this job I wanted it to last. This isn't my 1st vinyl fence that I've had installed but I can tell you the structural quality of this was superior to my previous vinyl fence from a local company. The complete install crew probably had an average of 15 + year's working for Daniel's. That alone says a lot about the company's values in a whole. Job Well done. Thank you. Steve H.

When they cut the line, they didn\u2019t seem to care. When they hit my neighbors gas line, creating an emergency situation, they were equally unapologetic. This gas line encroachment was noted on the survey I provided them. When the emergency TECO man arrived and asked where the leak was the man showed him and TECO asked for assistance digging to get to the line quickly. The worker told him no, he was on his lunch break, and it wasn\u2019t his fault. So, the TECO man dug it alone. When I told him to help anyways, he walked away. Suffice it to say, the execution was substandard. Kristen Local Guide \u2022 30 reviews \u2022 0 photos I had 196' of vinyl fence installed by Danielle Fence and I am very pleased with my experience. The sales representative, Thom, was very thorough and set clear expectations for the fence layout as we walked the property line. After signing the contract, someone promptly called me to schedule the install, and then called the day before to confirm. The install crew arrived on time and worked diligently to install the fence in one day. They paid attention to detail and were courteous to me as well as my neighbors. I would definitely recommend Danielle Fence to anyone in need of a fence, and I hope to use Danielle in the future for more outdoor projects."

There was only one access gate and we wanted to add a second one. Original fence company stated they \"don't do repairs\" and gave me the number of a local guy that they farm this type of work out to. He did not return my calls. Found someone else to do it but said I would have to get fence materials myself. Called Alumiguard up in Brooksville as they are the the manufacturer and was told they do not sell to public. However, the Alumi-guard person was extremely helpful and suggested I contact Danielle Fence. The lady I spoke to scheduled an estimate for the work we were wanting. Gentleman who came was on time, very professional, and provided a detailed estimate. We committed on the spot and actually added TWO additional gates. It took about a month for materials to arrive.

    "content": "Mario Cooper 13 reviews \u2022 1 photo Around March 2013 my wife and I decided to get a fence to keep our two young girls safe and to keep our yard private. We had Danielle Fence give us an estimate, and we had one main concern--that with the weather in FL we may suffer wind damage. Our salesperson Vince D told us that not only did our fence from Danielle have built-in protections, if wind did somehow tear our fence apart all we needed to do is gather our pieces and they would put the fence back together at no charge. That put us over the top--we were sold! Fast forward a year and a few months, a small summer storm or two has now forced one of our post footings above ground level causing our fence to bow outward which makes it even more vulnerable to wind damage. I reached out to Danielle and was told that what I was told was incorrect and that there was nothing they could do. I was told multiple times it would be escalated to a supervisor, but nothing ever came from that. In summary, we absolutely love our fence--the unbowed out part, but I wouldn't trust anything their salespeople tell you. Honestly, if they don't have enough integrity to stand behind their work and correct the wrongs of their greedy salesmen they don't deserve your business. If your people mess up, fix it. Don't run from it. We used to recommend Danielle Fence, but that probably will never happen again unless they make this right. Update: Shortly after posting a few negative online reviews, Danielle Fence came through and promptly fixed the problem we had. They cannot control what their sales employees improperly promise, but they did the right thing in making it right for us. They restored our faith in their company. Paula Cardinali Local Guide \u2022 17 reviews \u2022 2 photos Great company. They are friendly, fast, and very neat! I've had them out twice to my home now. Im installing my fence in sections.
